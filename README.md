# Emotion Recognition Study

This repository contains the study I went trough in order to create an emotion recognition neural network. I started from the very basics of machine learning and deep learning in order to understand how neural networks work in details and how to create different types of models for solving the emotion recognition task and how to train and fine-tuning them.
