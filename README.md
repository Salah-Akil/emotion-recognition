# Emotion Recognition Study

This repository contains the study I went trough in order to create an emotion recognition neural network. I started from the very basics of machine learning and deep learning in order to understand how neural networks work in details and how to create different types of models for solving the emotion recognition task and how to train and fine-tuning them.

The initial idea was to create a software capable of detecting faces in images or videos and perform emotion analysis on the detected faces. A further study was done on how modern and old face detection models work, a benchamrk test was created in order to pick the best model for face recognition, and only then I implemented the model in my software.
