# Hardware

Just for reference here is the hardware I used, it's not necessary to have a GPU but it reduces the training time significantly. If you don't have access to a dedicated graphics card you can use Google's [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and activate the free GPU available, the only inconvenience is that after a certain amount of time it disconnects, a monthly paid plan is available for accessing more features.

To generate the following report I created this little python [script](https://github.com/Salah-Akil/emotion-recognition/blob/main/scripts/system_information.py):
