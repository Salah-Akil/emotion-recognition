# Facial Expressions

Understanding emotions is really important for human interaction. A baby by the age of 1 can understand basic facial expressions such as anger, sadness, happiness and more. These facial expression influence the baby's emotions, to the point that an angry and grumpy face can make him feel distressed and cry.

Not only babies are influenced, also adults and animals can sense our emotions through our facial expressions. For example a dog can detect our anger and diverge its gaze. A person who do not speak our langue can understand if we are a danger to him or not simply by reading our facial expressions, so the ability to understand emotions through facial expressions is innate to humans and other animals such as primates or canines.

## 1. Universal Facial Expressions

Decades of research by Dr. Paul Ekman resulted in the classification of seven universal facial expressions that where found across all cultures around the world, from the people of Rome to the aborigines of Australia.
These expressions display:

* Anger
* Contempt
* Disgust
* Fear
* Happiness
* Sadness
* Surprise

## 2. Anger

Anger easily causes harm to ourselves and others. Psychologists are unclear about whether the wish to harm is built into the core of anger or if it is something we learn, but we know it often is a part of the anger process that gets us into trouble.

In both psychological and contemplative traditions, it is acknowledged that anger can be useful when it’s motivated by compassion and expressed with discernment. However, because anger can easily initiate a cycle of violence, one has to be very honest and clear in one’s assessment to determine whether or not it’s constructive anger.

When we are angry we are most likely to say or do things that hurt another person. Simply the fact that we got angry is hurtful for some people. The remedy? Focus on the action, not the actor: on what the other person did that made you angry, not on the other person him or herself.

### 2.1 Facial expression of Anger

In anger the eyebrows come down and together, the eyes glare, and there is a narrowing of the lip corners. During conscious suppression or unconscious repression of anger, the expression may be less obvious, though the person may show signs of their anger in a split-second micro [expression](https://www.paulekman.com/resources/micro-expressions/).

### 2.2 Vocal expression of Anger

For most, anger is vocalized as one of two ways: if not controlled, anger can even generate a roar or yell; when controlled it may have sharp edge to it.

### 2.3 Sensation of Anger

Typical sensations include: feeling hot, (hence the term “seeing red”), sweating, muscle tension, and clenching one’s jaw and/or fists.

### 2.4 Posture of anger

Most people find themselves leaning forward with their head/chin jutting forward and puffing their chest/body to appear larger.

## 3. Contempt

The least researched of the seven universal emotions, contempt is the feeling of dislike for and superiority (usually morally) over another person, group of people, and/or their actions. It has been accepted by many emotions experts to be a universal emotion, however, some emotions scientists still don’t distinguish contempt as a distinct emotion.

It’s widely believed that the function of contempt is to signal a feeling of superiority, of not needing to accommodate or engage, and to assert power or status.

### 3.1 Facial expression of Contempt

Contempt is the only emotion with a unilateral facial expression, meaning that the expression is not symmetrical. The expression of contempt can occur with or without a hint of a smile or angry expression.

### 3.2 Vocal expression of Contempt

Common vocal signals of contempt are smug or disapproving sounds/tone of voice.

### 3.3 Sensation of Contempt

Considering people have a variety of reactions to feeling contempt, the sensations associated with the feeling can be quite different depending on the situation. At times, it may be felt with sensations similar to anger (i.e., tension, heat, etc.) and other times may be felt with enjoyment (i.e., elevated, uplifted, etc.). It can also feel uncomfortable and/or embarrassing to feel.

### 3.4 Posture of Contempt

It’s common to “puff up” one’s chest, have upright posture, look “down your nose” at others, and/or roll one’s eyes.

## 4. Disgust

Disgust is one of the seven universal emotions and arises as a feeling of aversion towards something offensive. We can feel disgusted by something we perceive with our physical senses (sight, smell, touch, sound, taste), by the actions or appearances of people, and even by ideas.

The universal function of disgust is to get away from, block off, or eliminate something offensive, toxic or contaminating.

### 4.1 Facial expression of Disgust

The most easily recognizable and obvious sign of disgust is the wrinkling of the nose.

### 4.4 Posture of Disgust

Disgust often leads to physically turning the head or body away from the source of disgust. When disgust leads to nausea, reactions also include covering the nose/mouth and hunching over.

## 5 Fear

Fear is one of the seven universal emotions experienced by everyone around the world. Fear arises with the threat of harm, either physical, emotional, or psychological, real or imagined. While traditionally considered a “negative” emotion, fear actually serves an important role in keeping us safe as it mobilizes us to cope with potential danger.

The universal function of fear is to avoid or reduce harm. Depending on what we have learned in the past about what can protect us in dangerous situations, we are capable of doing many things we wouldn’t typically be able, or willing, to do in order to stop the threat.

The immediate threat of harm focuses our attention, mobilizing us to cope with the danger. In this way, fear can actually save our lives by forcing us to react without having to think about it (e.g., jumping out of the way of a car coming at us). The evolutionary preset actions of fear include fight, flight and freezing.

### 5.1 Facial expression of Fear

The facial expression of fear is often confused with surprise. While both expressions show distinctly raised eyebrows, a fear expression's eyebrows are straighter and more horizontal whereas in surprise they are raised and curved. The upper eyelid is also lifted higher in fear than in surprise, exposing more sclera (white of the eye). Finally, the lips are tensed and stretched in fear but more open and slack in surprise.

### 5.4 Posture of Fear

The posture of fear can either be one of mobilizing or immobilizing- freezing or moving away.

## 6. Happiness

Enjoyment is, for many, the most desirable of the seven universal emotions, typically arising from connection or sensory pleasure. The word happiness and enjoyment can be interchanged, although increasingly people use the word happiness to refer to their overall sense of well-being or evaluation of their lives rather than a particular enjoyment emotion.

As a social function, expressing enjoyment plays an important role in signaling friendliness and assuring that we are not a threat to others. Many emotions scientists agree that enjoyable emotions motivate us to do things that are, by and large, good for us and the survival of our species (i.e., reproducing and child-rearing). Many emotions scientists also agree that the pursuit of enjoyment is a primary motivation in our lives.

### 6.1 Facial expression of Happiness

A smile is the universal facial expression to signal a person’s happiness. However, there are types of smiles that we use when we don’t feel happiness such as when use a smile to signal learned and culturally-specific social functions, or when we use smile mask to conceal another emotion. A true enjoyment smile is called a Duchenne smile and is most frequently identified by observing “crows feet”.

## 7 Sadness

Sadness is one of the seven universal emotions experienced by everyone around the world resulting from the loss of someone or something important. What causes us sadness varies greatly based on personal and cultural notions of loss. While sadness is often considered a “negative” emotion, it serves an important role in signaling a need to receive help or comfort.

The universal function of sadness is to, in some way, signal for help. This can be a signal to others saying that we need comforting, or to ourselves to take some time and recoup from our loss.

### 7.1 Facial expression of Sadness

One very strong and reliable sign of sadness is the angling-up of the inner corners of the eyebrows. Few people are able to manipulate these muscles voluntarily, making it especially difficult to fake (unlike some other facial movements).

## 8 Surprise

Surprise is one of the seven universal emotions and arises when we encounter sudden and unexpected sounds or movements. As the briefest of the universal emotions, its function is to focus our attention on determining what is happening and whether or not it is dangerous.

Surprise is the briefest of all the emotions, lasting a few seconds at most. Other emotions can be very brief, but they can also endure much longer, whereas surprise has a fixed, limited duration.

Within seconds, surprise passes as we figure out what is happening. From there, surprise may merge into fear, amusement, relief, anger, disgust, and so forth depending upon what it was that surprised us. It may also be followed by no emotion at all if we determine that the surprising event was of no consequence to us.

The function of surprise is to focus our attention so we can determine what is happening and whether we are in danger or not.

### 8.1 Facial expression of Surprise

Fear and surprise are two of the most commonly confused facial expressions because they are shown in the same key features: eyebrows, eyes, and mouth. In surprise, the eyebrows are raised but show more curve than seen in fear. The upper eyelids and jaws are also more relaxed when expressing surprise.
